Kate FuzzyOpen plugin
---------------------
This plugin implements a fuzzy-style open dialog. The plugin can be invoked from the **Files > Fuzzy Open** menu action or via the **Meta+T** shortcut (Meta is usually the Windows key).

Installation
''''''''''''
Copy or link the fuzzyopen directory under *~/.kde4/share/apps/kate/pate/* to install it only for the current user, or do the same in */usr/share/apps/kate/pate/* to do it globally.

Requirements
''''''''''''
This plugin is developed in python and requires the `Pâté plugin system <https://github.com/mtorromeo/pate>`_ for Kate to be installed.
Note that this is a fork of the original project which contains some modifications that are required for the plugin to work.
